[x] Chaining of json_get operator '->'
    i.e. foo -> bar -> blah = ((foo -> bar) -> blah) = json_get(json_get(foo, bar), blah)
    json_field_access = expr -> (integer | string)
[x] Query with region as database name
[x] REPL auto completion
[x] Determine freshness of tables to avoid re-loading everytime
[x] Mechanism to inspect available tables [available via auto-complete]
[ ] Mechanism to inspect table schema


MAYBE WILL DO
==============

[ ] Constant, pre-loaded tables (e.g. ec2 instances pricing)
[ ] REPL multi-lines input
[ ] Better error msg on query parsing error (with viz of error position)
